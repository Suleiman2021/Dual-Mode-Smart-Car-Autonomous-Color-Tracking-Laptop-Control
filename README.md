# **Dual-Mode Smart Car — Autonomous Color Tracking & Laptop Control**

This project implements a dual-mode smart robotic vehicle powered by an **ESP32** and controlled via **Python**, **OpenCV**, and a **Kivy UI interface**.
The system can operate autonomously by tracking colors using a smartphone camera, or manually through a laptop control interface.

---

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

* Create a robotic car capable of **color-based autonomous navigation**
* Provide a **manual driving mode** using buttons on a laptop
* Send simple **single-character commands** to the ESP32 for movement
* Combine computer vision, socket communication, and embedded motor control

---

# 🚗 **How the System Works**

## 1️⃣ **Autonomous Color-Tracking Mode**

A **smartphone camera** is mounted at the front of the car.
The camera feed is sent to the Python script (`main.py`), which uses **OpenCV** to:

* Convert each frame to HSV
* Apply color masks (yellow, green, red, blue)
* Detect large contours
* Determine which color is visible
* Send a corresponding movement command to the ESP32

### **Color → Movement Mapping**

| Color  | Command | Action        |
| ------ | ------- | ------------- |
| Yellow | `'U'`   | Move Forward  |
| Green  | `'L'`   | Turn Left     |
| Red    | `'B'`   | Move Backward |
| Blue   | `'R'`   | Turn Right    |

The ESP32 receives these commands over Wi-Fi (TCP socket) and controls the motors accordingly.

---

## 2️⃣ **Manual Laptop Control Mode**

A Kivy interface (`control.kv`) provides on-screen buttons such as:

* **Front**
* **Back**
* **Left**
* **Right**
* **Stop**

When the user clicks a button, `main.py` sends the matching character:

| Button | Command |
| ------ | ------- |
| Front  | `'u'`   |
| Back   | `'b'`   |
| Left   | `'l'`   |
| Right  | `'r'`   |
| Stop   | `'s'`   |

The ESP32 interprets these characters and drives the motors.

# 🧠 **System Architecture**

```
Smartphone Camera → Python (OpenCV) → Wi-Fi Socket → ESP32 → Motor Driver → Car Motion
Laptop Buttons  → Python (Kivy UI) → Wi-Fi Socket → ESP32 → Motor Driver → Car Motion
```

# 🛠 **Technologies Used**

### **Software**

* Python
* OpenCV
* Kivy
* imutils
* ESP32 Arduino Framework
* TCP Socket Networking

### **Hardware**

* ESP32 Wi-Fi module
* Smartphone camera
* Motor driver (L298N or similar)
* DC motors
* Car chassis + battery

# 🔌 **Communication Protocol**

The Python app sends a single character to the ESP32 server at:

```
IP:   192.168.4.1
Port: 80
```

Example:

```python
sock = socket.socket()
sock.connect((host, port))
sock.send(b'U')   # Move forward
sock.close()
```

---

# 🚀 **How to Run the Project**

## **1. Flash ESP32**

Upload `SUPER_CAR.ino` to the ESP32.
The ESP32 becomes a Wi-Fi Access Point and starts a server at port 80.

## **2. Connect the Laptop to ESP32 Wi-Fi**

Example SSID:

```
ESP32-Car
```

## **3. Start Python Program**

```bash
python main.py
```

## **4. Choose Mode**

* **Manual Mode:** Use UI buttons
* **Autonomous Mode:** Enable tracking and show a color in front of the camera

# 📌 **Future Improvements**

* Add PID steering
* Improve color detection robustness
* Add Bluetooth/HTTP/WebSocket control
* Add voice-control mode
* Add obstacle avoidance
